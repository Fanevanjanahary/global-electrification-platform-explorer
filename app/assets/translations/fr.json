  "Examines the electricity demand target expressed in kWh/capita/year. The top-down scenarios introduce consistent Tier-based demand targets across all settlements based on their urban (U) and rural (R) status. In the low demand scenario, the urban demand target is informed by the average consumption observed in currently electrified areas in the country, translated into the nearest access Tier (e.g. U4 – Urban Tier 4). Low rural demand target is always set to Tier 1 (e.g. R1 – Rural Tier 1). The high demand target scenario reflects more aggressive goals. Urban demand target is increased by 1 Tier, unless already Tier 5, while rural demand target is increased by 2 Tiers. The bottom-up scenario assigns a unique demand target (kWh/cap/year) in each settlement, based on local poverty rate and GDP level.": "Examines the electricity demand target expressed in kWh/capita/year.

  "Indicates the electrification rate to be achieved in the first few years of the analysis (2025). In GEP it is assumed that final electrification rate is 100%, analysis considers 12 years (2018-2030) with an intermediate time step of 7 years. Not capped scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases linearly over the modelling years; no restrictions are set in terms of feasible grid connections per year. Capped growth scenario assumes that the electrification rate increases as in the first scenario but is subject to grid connections limitation, equal to 2.5% of population per year. In this case, grid electrified population slowly ramps up over the years of analysis following often an S-like curve.": "Indicates the electrification rate to be achieved in the first few years of the analysis (2025).

  "Examines different average costs of generating electricity by the power plants connected to the national grid. This cost is one of the factors that affect the LCoE of connecting to the grid (together with extension of the grid lines etc.), and can affect the split between grid- and off-grid technologies. Estimated on-grid cost scenario assumes an optimal generating cost of electricity by the central grid based on the Electricity Model Base for Africa (TEMBA). High on-grid cost scenario assumes a generating cost of electricity by the central grid increased by 25% so as to account for deviations from the optimal plan (construction delays, deployment of emergency fossil fuel based units etc.), which can increase generating cost affecting thus the split between grid- and off-grid technologies.": "Examines different average costs of generating electricity by the power plants connected to the national grid.

  "Examines the potential of electrification rollout plans for the country. Nationwide least cost approach works as follows: First, connections are ramped up in all already grid connected settlements. Then, un-electrified settlements are prioritized based on lowest investment cost per capita until the target electrification rate is reached. Note! a generation capacity limit for the centralized grid is applied in order to keep grid expansion to sensible levels. Grid connection within 1 km presents a rollout plan that considers “forced” grid connection in all settlements located within 1km from existing MV network.
